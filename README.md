Challenges faced and how I solved them is - After a long time without practicing JavaScript, I had to review the basics especially DOM manipulation. One of the main challenges also I faced was with the page as it was kept submitting to the thank-you page again and again even when filling nothing.But yeah, then I solved this by using onsubmit=”return validateForm()”.

Another challenge was properly linking different pages and styling paths.But yeah now I realized that how folder structure affects HTML.I also faced an issue while uploading the project to GitHub Pages. Initially, the files were inside a subfolder, so the site didn’t load properly.But later, somehow i cracked it.
